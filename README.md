# AAF-GWAS
=======

AAF-GWAS tries to find k-mers that are associated with certain trait (e.g. drug resistance of pathogens) in a species, or even across different species (e.g. different breeding system in one genus). 

This project is still in working progress. Everything is still in R but will be packaged in python eventually.
