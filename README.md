# AAF-GWAS
=======

AAF-GWAS tries to find _k_-mers that are associated with certain trait (e.g. drug resistance of pathogens) in one species, or even across different species (e.g. different breeding systems in one genus). 

This project is still in working progress. Everything is still in R but will be packaged in python eventually.
